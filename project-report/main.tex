In recent study an increasing amount of time has been spent researching complex systems. The reason for this is an increasing need for solving complex
problems where the traditional Von Neumann architecture lacks sufficient
efficiency. A specific complex system which has been growing in popularity
is a system of swarm robots. Introducing evolutionary principles in such
systems makes an attempt at collective computation, from simple elements,
to resolve complex problems. To further add functionality to such systems,
self-organizing techniques, such as self-assembly, have been introduced. Because of the lack of research literature within this paradigm, there are few
comparisons of the different implementations of self-assembly mechanisms.
This thesis outlines some mechanisms of self-assembly and explores the positive and negative implications these may have on evolutionary self-assembling robots.

\chapter*{Preface}
\vspace{-2cm}
This master thesis is written at the Department of Computer and Information Science at NTNU during the spring semester of 2016. 
During their 8th semester, students are exposed to a number of different projects which are provided by the IDI faculty and professors at NTNU.
These projects are open to interpretation by the students to enable their own creativity.
This thesis builds on a research project conducted during the autumn of 2015, which had the following project description:

\begin{center}

\textit{"Self-assembly mechanisms are useful in collective robotics in order to allow a group of robots to cross obstacles that a single robot could not cross. Another use of such mechanism is the drag heavy objects by multiple robots. In the last years multiple mechanisms have been proposed in the literature. The first task of the student will be to list these mechanisms find the relevant axes to classify the self-assembly mechanisms of the literature. The second task will be to compare these mechanisms. More specifically, an evolutionary algorithm will be selected for its ability to learn behaviours in groups of robots. Additionally a task will be selected or designed for its proper level of challenge (that can be addressed thanks to self-assembly). Finally,the algorithm will be used on the task with the various mechanisms located, and comparisons will be made on the difficulties to evolve behaviours using self-assembly."\\}

\end{center}

From the researched project during 2015, several interesting research scopes were discovered.
An initial experiment was outlined during the project which was elaborated and continued throughout this thesis.
Exploring the different mechanisms and behaviours of swarm-robotics became the foundation of this thesis.
