\chapter{Parallelization}
In the experiments described in this study, the bulk of processing time is spent evaluating the genomes using roborobo.
The genome evaluations are independent of each other, and is therefore a good candidate for parallelization.
With a great number of global variables, the roborobo framework itself is not easily parallelized.
The solution was to use \emph{Message passing interface(MPI)} to run multiple cooperating roborobo processes. 

The parallelization is done by letting one root process take responsibility for running the evolutionary algorithm, with multiple slave processes for evaluating the genomes.

At the beginning of each generation the root process generates the new genomes from the evolutionary algorithm.
The new genomes are then distributed evenly to each process, see figure \ref{fig:distribute-genomes}.
Once all the genomes are evaluated, the root process gathers the evaluated genomes from the slave processes, see figure \ref{fig:gather-genomes}.
The evaluated genomes are then used by the evolutionary algorithm to create the next generation.
This process is repeated until the target fitness is reached or a processing threshold is met. 

\chapter{Live graphing tool}
Since the evaluation is quite time consuming, there was need for a tool that could give feedback during the simulation instead of having to wait for it to complete.
A simple "live" graph which plots fitness statistics was therefore created, pictured in figure \ref{fig:live-graph}
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

Having such a tool makes it easier to evaluate how well new configurations are working, and saves time by shortening the feedback cycle.
