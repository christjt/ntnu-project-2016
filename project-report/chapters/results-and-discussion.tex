This chapter shows the results of the simulations done with the framework shown in ch. \ref{ch:methodology} as well as discussing the results.
The chapter is mainly divided into two sections, the first explaining the configuration of the simulation as well as results depicted by graph-data.
The second section focuses on discussing the results in terms of the reason they have certain values and graphs, as well as a comparison between the different simulations and discovery of correlations and behavioural similarities.

\section{Experimental Results}
As stated in the chapter introduction, this section covers the results of the simulations. 
Even though the simulator supports a wide variety of different configurations, three main simulation groups chosen for this particular study.
The first group considers different connection port configurations for the robots.
The second simulation group varies the environment that the robots spend their life time in.
The third and final simulation group aims to observe the affect of local communication between the robots in a self-assembly structure(the implementation is shown in sec. \ref{sec:local_comm}).
The two first simulation groups targets to contribute to the three main self-assembly mechanisms discussed in ch. \ref{ch:background}(Self-assembly Architectures, Hardware Mechanisms and Assembly Protocols).
The local communication simulation group aims to study the affect giving the robots the ability to perform simple communication between the robots in a group.

\subsection{Port Configuration}
The first group of simulations that were done was varying the number of connection ports of the robots and their configuration.
These simulations where done such that one could record and discuss the impact of connections between the robots.
In more detail, this group of experiments where conducted such that one could record:

\begin{itemize}
	\item How the number of ports affected the general performance of the system based on the number of ports.
	\item If there is any noticeable difference in the self-assembly architecture.
	\item In what way the port configuration promotes self-assembly, both in therms of the sizes of the different robot groups, and the number of groups.
	\item How the port configuration affect the fitness of the experiment, in terms of convergence and final result.
\end{itemize}

The goal of running these simulations is to make correlations between its results to show how configuring the hardware mechanism can affect a self-assembly system
